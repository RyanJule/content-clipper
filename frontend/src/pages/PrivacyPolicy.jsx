      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Content Clipper</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”). This Privacy Policy describes how we
        collect, use, and protect your information when you use our website, application, and related
        services (collectively, the “Service”).
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        If you do not agree with this policy, please discontinue use of the Service.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect the following types of information to operate and improve our Service:</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.1 Personal Information</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>Name and email address — provided when you register or connect your account.</li>
        <li>
          OAuth credentials — used to connect your social media accounts securely. These credentials are
          stored in an encrypted format and are never shared with third parties outside necessary API
          integrations (e.g., posting on your behalf).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.2 Usage and Engagement Data</h3>
      <p>
        We automatically collect engagement and performance data, including page visits, interactions,
        device type, browser, IP address, and timestamps. This helps us analyze trends, maintain
        performance, and improve user experience.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.3 Media Files</h3>
      <p>
        If you upload or store content (images, videos, posts), we collect and store these files securely
        for your use within the app. These files remain your property; we only store and process them to
        deliver the Service.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">2. How We Use the Information</h2>
      <p>We use collected information to:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the Service</li>
        <li>Authenticate users and manage connected accounts</li>
        <li>Enable posting, scheduling, and media management</li>
        <li>Analyze engagement and app performance</li>
        <li>Communicate with you regarding updates or support</li>
        <li>Improve user experience and platform functionality</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-2">We do <strong>not</strong> sell or rent your personal information to third parties.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We may share limited data only in the following cases:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>
          <strong>Service providers:</strong> Trusted third parties who help operate the Service (e.g., cloud
          storage, analytics). These providers are bound by confidentiality and data protection agreements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal compliance:</strong> When required by law or to protect our rights and the rights of
          other users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Social media APIs:</strong> Limited to the permissions you grant during OAuth connection.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        Your data is stored securely using industry-standard encryption and access control. OAuth tokens are
        encrypted and stored separately from other user data. While we use strong safeguards, no system can
        guarantee complete security, and you acknowledge this risk by using the Service.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        We may use cookies and similar technologies to remember preferences, track engagement, and improve
        functionality. You can manage or disable cookies through your browser settings.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">6. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain your data only as long as necessary to provide the Service or comply with legal
        obligations. You may request deletion of your data or account at any time (see Section 8).
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">7. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>

        of your data, and to withdraw consent at any time. To exercise these rights, contact us at{" "}

        is handled securely and in accordance with this Policy.
      </p>
